1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Sometimes we may want to use the code already available on a remote repository and add changes to it or when we work in a group and suppose, we want everyone to be able to make changes and experiment, then we may not prefer to keep work local.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might not want to include every change or every new feature in our local repo from the remote repo, so pulling manually enables us to be flexible with our choices.
